            <p class="paragraph">Hi, I'm Vincent.<br><br>
                Metairie native and recent graduate from Loyola University New Orleans, I am a tech-savvy 
                indie electronic artist whose focus lies on art and its place in the natural world. In univeristy, I studied
                Music Industry Studies and Spanish, picking up an interest in web design along the way. My style explores the many ways music, 
                technology, and culture intersect to form meaning. 
                <br><br>
                Under the pseudonym Leaf Stone, I  
                released my first EP, "Leaf Bug," in March, 2023. Written, produced, mixed, and mastered by myself, 
                "Leaf Bug" delivers lush ambient and environmental instrumentals through an electronic canvas, 
                and gained me a small community of listeners. 
                <br><br>
                Along with my art, I am also drawn to everything audio technology. My experience in mixing, producing,
                and engineering combined with my ambitions in programming, synthesis, and web design have left me with a 
                passion for audio tech, and, having finished my time at Loyola in May of 2024, I am excited
                to see where my next steps take me.
