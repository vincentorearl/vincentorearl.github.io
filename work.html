                My experience in audio comes from my years of experience writing, producing, and engineering 
                my own music, the audio production and music tech classes I have taken, and my work at festivals and in media. I have 
                experience with both Digital Audio Workstations as well as live sound systems. At the 2024 New Orleans Jazz & Heritage
                Festival, I interned as a <b>recording engineer</b> for <a href="https://www.munck-music.com/" target="_blank"> Munck Music</a>, who operates 'Jazz Fest Live.'
                There, I was in charge of recording the stage audio from our rigs backstage,
                assuring clean audio quality, compiling setlists, and creating accurate input lists for our team 
                (who then mix, and master, and distribute the performances as live albums).  
                <br><br> 
                In 2023, I completed an internship with WYES New Orleans, a non-profit, community broadcasting 
                station affiliated with PBS. At WYES, I was a <b>Digital Media</b> intern, often  
                editing to-be-aired programming as well as doing camera work for their Thursday local culture show, 
                <em>Steppin' Out</em> with Peggy Laborde. For <em>Steppin' Out</em>, I shot <a href="https://youtu.be/bB-SOI8e7_Y?si=Xmg4X6LLVLwrX1bh&t=510" 
                target="_blank"> live performances</a> for musical guests, including
                Jason Scheff, bassist and vocalist for the legendary band Chicago, and Greg Barnhill, Emmy and
                and Grammy nominated songwriter and artist. 
                <br><br>
                My experience in <b>web design</b> is seen in the two websites (including this one) that I made from scratch. 
                I am currently learning Python, a more advanced language, and I am looking to start doing freelance 
                web design soon. My first website, <em><a href="https://vincentorearl.github.io/2005-internet-magazine/index.html" target="_blank">
                The 2005: Internet Magazine</em></a>, was a digital take on the popular art magazine genre, where I 
                showcased unique artists and wrote small blurbs about their artistc visions.
